# üöÄ GStreamer on Jetson Nano: Real-Time Camera Streaming with Hardware Acceleration

## Why GStreamer on Jetson Nano?

GStreamer enables real-time, hardware-accelerated video pipelines on NVIDIA Jetson Nano‚Äîideal for AI, computer vision, or robotics at the edge. With NVIDIA‚Äôs GPU plugins (like `nvv4l2decoder` and `nvarguscamerasrc`), you can capture, decode, and process video streams efficiently in Python or C++.

## üî• Quickstart

1. **Clone this repo**
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/<youruser>/jetson-gstreamer-rtsp-opencv.git
    cd jetson-gstreamer-rtsp-opencv
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**
    - OpenCV with GStreamer (check with `python3 -c "import cv2; print(cv2.getBuildInformation())"`)
    - GStreamer plugins:
      ```
      sudo apt-get install python3-opencv gstreamer1.0-tools gstreamer1.0-plugins-{good,bad,ugly} gstreamer1.0-libav
      ```

3. **Set your RTSP camera URL** in `rtsp_gst_opencv.py`:
    ```
    RTSP_URL = "rtsp://username:password@<camera-ip>/stream1"
    ```

4. **Run the script:**
    ```
    python3 rtsp_gst_opencv.py
    ```

## üì∑ Example Output

Running the pipeline displays periodic logs and opens the camera stream.  
Sample screenshot below confirms hardware decoding and real-time streaming:

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting & Tips

- **`Failed to open RTSP via GStreamer.`**
    - Confirm GStreamer plugins are present (`gst-inspect-1.0 nvv4l2decoder`)
    - Make sure OpenCV is built with GStreamer enabled
    - Test parts of your pipeline with `gst-launch-1.0` to isolate problems
- For best performance, use NVIDIA-accelerated elements: `nvv4l2decoder`, `nvarguscamerasrc`, `nvvidconv`, `nveglglessink`.
- Capabilities/caps errors? Make sure each pipeline element is compatible; use explicit `video/x-raw` caps as shown in the code.

## üèÉ Key GStreamer Commands

- **Prototype a camera/decode pipeline:**
    ```
    gst-launch-1.0 nvarguscamerasrc ! 'video/x-raw(memory:NVMM),width=1280,height=720,framerate=30/1' ! nvoverlaysink -e
    ```
- **Inspect plugins (does Jetson acceleration work?):**
    ```
    gst-inspect-1.0 nvv4l2decoder
    ```
- **Debug pipeline issues:**
    ```
    GST_DEBUG="*:3" gst-launch-1.0 videotestsrc ! autovideosink
    ```
